# Mission-to-Mars

This repository is an assignment to create a Flash App using html, and to use this app to do the following:

The data contained within this project is a look at Mars. The index.html file when accessed through a chrome browser will show a featured news title and summary, a table containing data on Mars, and a photo of each hemisphere.

The page also contains a 'Scrape New Data' button, which will access all of the data sources and update them through the automatic use of Chrome browser.

Programs: VS Code, Jupyter Notebook, Mongo, Flash, Splinter (automated scraping).
